tldr; You'll learn how to grow your wealth without watering down your values.

The world of finances is akin to a long trek across a desert, buzzards overhead and no water in sight. Capitalism, in its rawest form, thrives on exploitation: of people, of resources, of the land, which feels...well wrong. For the longest time, I avoided investing entirely because it felt like choosing between survival and my values.

Eventually, living in a state of permanent financial drought lost its charm. I started to dig into sustainable investing and realized there is actually a path to grow your money _without_ investing in climate collapse, wage theft, or weapons of war.

This guide walk you through what sustainable investing really means, how to spot greenwashing, and how to build a portfolio that grows your financial independence while also reflecting your ethics.

## What is Sustainable Investing

Sustainable investing goes by a few names (ESG, SRI, impact investing), but the idea is simple: use your money to support things you think are good.

### A Quick Sustainable Investing Glossary

**ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)**

- **Environmental factors**: Carbon emissions, resource usage, pollution, renewable energy adoption, waste management
- **Social factors**: Employee relations, diversity and inclusion, human rights, community engagement, data privacy
- **Governance factors**: Board composition, executive compensation, business ethics, transparency, shareholder rights

**SRI (Socially Responsible Investing)**

SRI typically involves exclusionary screening‚Äîavoiding investments in companies or industries that conflict with an investor's values:

- Common exclusions include tobacco, weapons, gambling, adult entertainment, and fossil fuels.
- May also screen based on religious values, animal welfare concerns, or other ethical considerations
- Historically the oldest form of sustainable investing, dating back to religious investors avoiding "sin stocks". 

**Impact Investing**

- Directly funds projects or companies aiming for measurable social or environmental change.
- Think solar microgrids in underserved communities or women/queer-led startups in emerging markets.

**Thematic Investing**

Thematic investing concentrates on specific sustainability trends or challenges:

- Focuses on causes you care about: renewable energy, clean water, healthcare, LGBTQ+ equality, gender quality, etc.
- Often via ETFs or mutual funds centered on one mission.

This approach allows investors to focus on areas they're particularly passionate about while potentially capitalizing on long-term sustainability trends.

### Greenwashing Alert

Not every fund with "green" or "sustainable" in the title lives up to it. Do your own research. Check holdings. Use sites like [Fossil Free Funds](https://fossilfreefunds.org/) or [As You Sow](https://www.asyousow.org/) to evaluate your choices. In general it is better to trust what you've learned about a company that to have the company tell you, "Trust us we are the best thing for planet earth üòâ". You know what your values are better than anyone, so trust you will make the right choices.

### The Growth of Sustainable Investing

The good news is investing ethically doesn't mean you're doomed to low returns. 

- ESG portfolios often perform as well or _better_ than traditional ones.
- Companies with strong ESG practices tend to be more resilient during downturns.
- Millenials, women, and queer folks are driving demand for values-aligned investing. Meaning more options and pressure on companies are growing.

Not to mention, sustainable investing will let you support the kind of world you actually want to live in, vote with you money, this is the love language of capitalism. Support companies who care about their workers, the planet, and their impact on marginalized communities. 

## How to Build a Sustainable Investment Portfolio

### Step One: Define What Matters to You

Ask yourself:
- What industries do I want to swerve from?
- What issues do I support and I'm passionate about? (climate, racial justice, gender equality, etc.)
- Do I want to prioritize returns or impact? Maybe both?
- Do I want to be hands-on (picking stocks) or automated (set and forget) approaches?

### Step Two: Choose Your Tools

You can build a sustainable portfolio using:

**Robo-advisors:**

- [Ellevest](https://www.ellevest.com/) ‚Äì Designed by women, with gender-lens investing
- [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/) ‚Äì Offers SRI portfolios with different focuses
- [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/socially-responsible-investing)- Offers SRI approaches to investing

**ETFs and Mutual Funds:**

- [Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/esgv) ‚Äì Broad U.S. ESG exposure
- [Parnassus Core Equity Fund (PRBLX)](https://www.parnassus.com/parnassus-mutual-funds/core-equity/investor-shares) ‚Äì Actively managed, socially screened
- [Domini Impact Equity Fund (DSEFX)](https://www.domini.com/domini-funds/domini-impact-equity-fund) ‚Äì Prioritizes racial and gender equity
- [SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE)](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-msci-usa-gender-diversity-etf-she) ‚Äì Focused on women in leadership

**DIY Investing:**
- Buy individual stocks of B Corps, clean energy companies, or those with strong ESG ratings.

### Step 3: Watch Out for Fees and Fluff

- Sustainable funds can carry higher fees. Compare expense ratios.
- Look into what ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù means for each fund. Some are more bark than bite.

### Step 4: Set It and Check It

- Automate investments if possible
- Review annually (or when your values shift)
- Use tools like [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/) or [MSCI ESG Fund Ratings](https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/esg-investing/esg-fund-ratings): to track ESG performance

## Sustainable Investing That Reflects You

If you‚Äôre queer, femme, disabled, or just deeply skeptical of systems that weren‚Äôt built with you in mind. Then traditional investing advice might feel alienating.

But sustainable investing? It can be a reclamation. A way to participate in capitalism _on your own terms and nudge the system in a better direction as you go.

Is it perfect? No. But it‚Äôs a start. And it‚Äôs better than sitting on the sidelines while your savings lose value to inflation.

Start small. Start now. Let your money grow like a garden you actually want to live in.
