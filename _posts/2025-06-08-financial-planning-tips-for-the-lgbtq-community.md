There is a lot of social uncertainty in 2025 when you're queer. It's a fantastic idea to have a view on your current financial situation and plan ahead, especially if you're planning on buying a home, moving out of the country (if you live in the USA), or simply trying to manage cash flow and savings. Personally, I'm trying to help my spouse pay their way through college, and then more distantly we are planning on expanding our family.

Pride month is a time to celebrate our community. To reflect on what makes us fabulous and to consider the hardships that shape us. 

Financial planning for us may be more nuanced than for the average person. Focusing on this nuance is definitely part of our unique situation, especially with uncertainty around rights and protections that impact a very diverse queer community.

As a first-gen queer professional, I know all too well the internal pressure to only spend money on things considered "urgent" or "productive." I will feel a drop of guilt when I consider getting myself nice things, or when I take leisure time. And honey, if you're leisure time needs to be productive, then I've got news... Relaxation, rest, travel, and enjoying beautiful spaces are not meant to be luxuries, they are necessities. Spending money to live well is ABSOLUTELY NOT an afterthought; it's the point. It's not about reaching some eventual paradise where you can prance around without a care in the world, it's about creating value and joy in your life right now. 

This is why I spend so much money on food. I love eating high quality, delicious food. Even more so I love growing it myself. Sure, I could save $200 a month by choosing cheaper ingredients, but I'm not willing to compromise on this. Enjoying good food gives me far more than money ever will. It's a part of my wellness strategy, it's a part of how I show myself love. 

Stepping away from the grind isn't checking out, being avoidant, and it's definitely not selfish, I would argue that it is mandatory. 

Financial planning is about setting yourself up to embrace who you are, your unique identity. If you want to be a goat farmer, then start drafting the plan and visualize you on that farm. If you're a digital nomad, consider how you can detach from fixed commitments, and make the leap. 

Financial freedom isn't a distant promised land. It's about having the freedom to live on your own terms, now. There are many ways to fund this, and many ways we can tweak our lives to make room for our dreams to grow and flourish. This isn't a "five to ten years from now" project. It's something you can start now.

## Emergency Financial Planning and Safety Net Building

Traditional advice says to save three to six months of expenses, but that guidance doesn’t always match the realities of LGBTQ+ life. In fact, research shows that 21.6% of LGBTQ+ people live in poverty, compared to 15.7% of straight cisgender people. For transgender individuals and bisexual women, that number jumps to 29.4% ([Williams Institute](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/National-LGBT-Poverty-Oct-2019.pdf)).

Queer folks are also more likely to experience food insecurity, six times more likely, according to data from [LGBT Funders](https://lgbtfunders.org/resources/issues/economic-opportunity/). And employment instability adds another layer: in 2022, over a third of LGBTQ+ households earned under $30,000 per year ([IWPR](https://iwpr.org/the-lgbtqia-community-needs-more-than-equal-pay/)).

Employment instability is the crux of why we need to have an emergency plan, to avoid that nebulous space of unemployment or under-employment. It is shown time and again, that traditional emergency fund guidelines may not address the cascading effects of housing security, healthcare access, and covering basic survival needs. Let alone offer someone enough breathing room to actually build that fund in the first place. 

### What You Can Do About it

If you're living paycheck to paycheck or already feeling financially overextended, the sage wisdom of "save six months of expenses" kinda comes across as unrealistic, insensitive, and even discouraging. But here is a reframing so that you can get started on setting yourself up with a safety net. 

#### 1. Start With Your Personal Minimum Viable Fund

Start with a personal minimum viable fund. Rather than thinking about 6 months, identify the bare-minimum monthly survival expenses (rent, food, meds, transit) and work towards saving one months worth of just that. This may come with some discomfort, but the relief of being patient with yourself and starting to grow that cushion will be profound I promise. This number is also likely much smaller than your total budget and gives you a much more palatable milestone.

#### 2. Use community-first financial tools

I suggest stashing any emergency savings into a high-yield savings account with no fees and low minimums. I've suggested and use Ally, and Fidelity for banking, and cash management accounts respectively because of their competitive interest rates. But you can also explore community-based tools, such as local mutual aid networks, queer-centered financial collectives, or a rotating savings group ([ROSCA](https://medium.com/@raundtablez/five-things-to-do-before-starting-a-rotating-savings-group-373c1425de66)) if you have a close network of people that you trust with money. 

#### 3. Build Safety Layers, Not Just Savings

Sometimes saving isn't yet an option, and like all good security there are usually layers to ensure success. Here are some things I've done in the past to get through the harder times:
- Look for small side hustles that capitalize on your skills. I was always pretty good with computers so when things were looking bleak I would offer on-site computer repair services to my community, or take on small web development projects for local businesses. Even making an extra 100 dollars a week doing random jobs for neighbors can give you the momentum you need to break the cycle of being a little behind.
- Identify 2-3 friends or family members, or community networks that you can lean on in a true emergency. This can be for couch-surfing, covering a prescription, or helping find job connections.
- Create a toolkit, this can be stuff like a social media platform for a service you could offer, virtual skills for freelancing, or on-demand dog sitting, or delivery apps, that way you have something prepared if your income drops. It's better to have this setup in advance so that any "unexpected" turns are met with your well laid plan. Full disclosure that's why I started this blog, because sometimes there are gaps in my contract work.

#### 4. Plan For Specific Risk Scenarios

 For trans folks, this might mean budgeting for medical travel, or saving toward potential relocation from hostile legislation. For those who are estranged from family, it could mean creating a plan for housing loss. Write out some "what if" scenarios, then setup a practical Plan B to address each. 

#### 5. Plug Into Existing Support

You are not alone, hardship isn't a new thing that exist just to make you suffer. Humanity didn't make it this far through hostility, and apathy towards one another, but through collaboration. You do not need to bootstrap stability entirely on your own, but you do have to have the courage to ask for help. Some places to look:

- [TransBar’s emergency relocation fund](https://transbar.org/emergency-funds-for-relocating-and-supporting-families-and-transgender-individuals/)
- Local LGBTQ+ centers with financial aid or referrals.
- Crisis grants like [Point of Pride](https://www.pointofpride.org/) for trans healthcare

Here are some apps that you may consider for community support:

## Strategic Career and Income Protection

Wage gaps and discrimination aren’t abstract they show up in paychecks. Gay men earn 32% less than straight men. Bisexual women earn 30% less than straight women. Trans individuals are four times more likely to earn less than $10,000 annually according to [LGBTQ Economics](https://lgbtq-economics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LGBTQ-Wealth-Gap-Summary.pdf).

These numbers persist even with higher educational attainment in our community. It’s not about skills, it’s about bias. One in ten LGBTQ+ workers reports discrimination in hiring or salary decisions as seen in this [wealth gap summary](https://lgbtq-economics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LGBTQ-Wealth-Gap-Summary.pdf).

**What to consider:**
- Maintain documentation: resumes, reviews, and offers can help in disputes  
- Use resources like [MAP](https://www.lgbtmap.org/policy-and-issue-analysis/lgbtq-economic-security) to track state-by-state legal protections  
- Explore remote or portable careers as a hedge against hostile environments.
- Union jobs or public service roles may offer additional protection  

## Ethical and Community-Conscious Spending

Queer folks are often deeply values-driven in our spending. But ethical spending often means higher prices. Whether it’s supporting LGBTQ-owned businesses, avoiding rainbow-washing brands, or choosing safer, higher-quality products.

The current political climate has dramatically increased focus on corporate accountability and brought forward genuine inclusion versus performative allyship. Who resisted getting rid of DEI initiatives versus who didn't is a good litmus test. 

At the same time, nearly half of LGBTQ+ consumers report difficulty saving money despite spending similarly to their cis/straight peers ([LGBTQ Economics](https://lgbtq-economics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LGBTQ-Wealth-Gap-Summary.pdf)). Have you seen the price of a 100% cotton t-shirt? It's kinda nutty. 

One thing I love about our community is that we are often driven to supporting LGBTQ+, women and bipoc owned companies. These products may come at a higher cost, but these purchasing habits server the dual purpose of supporting personal values while contributing to the economic wellbeing of someone(s) in our community. 

**Practical ways to align values and budget:**
- Create a “values” category in your budget that allows for intentional, guilt-free spending  
- Use lists like [Real Simple’s LGBTQ+ brand guide](https://www.realsimple.com/shopping/lgbtq-owned-brands) to shop inclusively  
- Time big purchases around sales or mutual aid fundraisers  
- Balance matters it’s okay to not make every dollar a protest. Intentionality counts . 

## Legal and Estate Planning for Non-Traditional Families

The LGBTQ+ community's diverse family structures and relationship configuration are one of the things that make use beautiful, but comes with unique legal and financial planning needs that are not covered by traditional estate planning approaches. Many queer people don’t have access to the default legal protections heterosexual nuclear families do. That includes inheritance rights, hospital visitation rights, and medical decision-making. Scenarios like: unmarried partners, chosen families, polyamory,  and non-biological children face certain legal vulnerabilities that will require a more proactive plan to ensure financial security and asset protection. 

Even post-marriage equality, many couples remain unmarried due to financial or legal concerns. And children raised in LGBTQ+ families, especially by non-biological parents, can face serious legal vulnerabilities. Unmarried partners may lack automatic inheritance rights, they may be barred from hospital visits, and Social Security survivor benefits that married couples receive. These gaps require explicit work to overcome, and filing the correct legal documentation. 

Then there is the intersection of marital status and tax planning, which creates a whole web of considerations for financial planning. Marriage can provide tax advanatages by  offering joint filing and various spousal benefits, but it may also create penalties for high-earning couples or impact eligibility for certain government benefits. This is why some couples will deliberately remain unmarried to retain their financial independence. 

Unfortunately, and quite tragically, a part of LGBTQ+ estate planning may involve considerations of potential family rejection and estrangement. That would complicate or competely eliminate traditional inheritance or the passing on of generational wealth. 

**Steps to take:**
- Write or update your will  
- Assign powers of attorney for healthcare and finances  
- Ensure all accounts have clear, current beneficiary designations  
- For non-biological parents, look into second-parent adoption or legal guardianship  

Resources like [Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/six-key-estate-planning-issues-gay-lesbian-couples.html) offer helpful legal overviews.

## Geographic and Political Risk Assessment

In 2025, where you live may be one of your biggest financial decisions. The policy shifts from Project 2025 (like rescinding LGBTQ+ protections in schools and defining gender by executive order) are more than symbolic. They affect access to healthcare, safety, and housing ([Interfaith Alliance](https://interfaithalliance.org/post/project-2025-in-trumps-first-month-the-threat-to-lgbtq-rights-and-freedoms)).

Specific policy changes include the rescinding of Biden-era Title IX policies that protected LGBTQ+ students from discrimination in schools and universities, and Executive Order 14168 which officially recognizes only two genders, male and female[5](https://interfaithalliance.org/post/project-2025-in-trumps-first-month-the-threat-to-lgbtq-rights-and-freedoms). These policy changes create immediate safety and economic implications for transgender individuals and families with LGBTQ+ children, potentially necessitating relocation for safety and access to services.

Emergency relocation funds reflect the severity of geographic risk facing our community. Some organizations now provide funding specifically for individuals and families that are impacted by anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and sentiments. This can help individuals that are between a rock and a hard place get the resources they need to relocate and access services outside of their current state. 

**If you’re considering relocating:**
- Create a realistic relocation budget, including housing, job search costs, and moving expenses. 
- Explore city guides for your city (there are too many for me to list here).
- A list of LGBTQ+ friendly [workplaces](https://rankings.newsweek.com/americas-greatest-workplaces-lgbtq-2025)
- If international relocation is on your radar, look into visa programs in LGBTQ+-affirming countries like [Portugal](https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/golden-visa-portugal/) or [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html)  

Some relocation grants and mutual aid funds now exist for LGBTQ+ families fleeing unsafe states. Check out [TransBar](https://transbar.org/emergency-funds-for-relocating-and-supporting-families-and-transgender-individuals/) and [ACLU trackers](https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2025)

## Why Higher Education Still Matters for Queer Students (and How I Paid for it)

I can only speak from personal experience, and I recognize it comes from a place of privilege. I had the backing of family, a supportive partner and roommate, and community-based financial aid to help me get through the process. This was one of the highest impact changes to my life direction and income opportunities. I was lucky to find a college that was very into the fact that I was a poor rural queer trying to improve my life. 

Despite having support this was still probably one of the hardest things I've ever manage to accomplish in my life. 

I was carrying the emotional weight of having dropped out 12 years prior. This was back when I was depressed, living dysfunctionally, and trying to understand my identity after coming out as trans. Going back brought up a lot of intense feelings. The anxiety hit me pretty hard, but unlike before I had a plan, and I knew in my soul that this was the direction for me.

I was motivated to make it through this time, come hell or high water. I had an, "I could not fail attitude," in the most positive way. I even managed to finish my 4 year degree in a little over two years, which I don't necessarily recommend. 

Not working allowed me to maintain near perfect grades. I know that scenario isn't realistic for most, especially if you have others depending on you. That kept the scholarship door open. Not every opportunity requires a polished GPA. I found that most had reasonable expectations that left room for being human. But it definitely helped when I had to explain why I was committed and why I was worth investing in. 

## Paying for Higher Education as a Queer Person in the U.S. (2025)

**Why Higher Education Matters for LGBTQ+ Individuals**

We have established that our community often ends up navigating a patchwork of instability with housing, family support, healthcare, mental health, and job security. For some of us, college can be that turning point, that breath of fresh mountain air. Not because it magically fixes what's broken in society, but because it can create a path out of survival mode.

Degrees open doors. Not universally, and definitely not without strings, but they still are an impactful way to potentially transform our future. For me it came with the sheer relief of having completed something I failed at previously. It the sweet nectar of redemption, a huge boost to my spirits, and proof that I could overcome endless challenge to better my situation.

Beyond the potential for better-paying jobs, professional networks, and more secure workplaces, college can also be a place to find community. If you're lacking in support or affirmation, you might finally find your people, friends who see you, spaces that affirm your identity.

**How to Pay for it When You're Broke and Queer**

Here are some of the financial tools and support systems that may be available to you:

#### Federal + State Aid

- **Pell Grants, Work-Study, and Federal Loans** are still available and not contingent on identity, just financial need.
- Many **state-level programs** offer additional grants or tuition waivers. Some states are starting to implement targeted support for students from marginalized backgrounds, including queer and trans folks.
    
#### LGBTQ+ Scholarships

- There are scholarships out there _specifically_ for LGBTQ+ students, some for folks pursuing particular fields (like law, media, or healthcare), others more general.
- These are often less competitive than mainstream scholarships, and many prioritize students who’ve faced family rejection or other systemic barriers.
    
#### Local + Community Resources

- Your **local LGBTQ+ center** or community organization may have emergency funds, microgrants, housing support, or just folks who know where to point you.
- Don’t underestimate mutual aid or informal community support sometimes help doesn’t look official, but it still gets you through.

#### Keep One Eye on Policy

- Aid programs are constantly shifting with the political landscape.
- Stay informed and flexible. Look into multiple funding options and backup plans if possible.

**Personal Note**

> From personal experience, community support and proactive pursuit of scholarships and aid (like Pell Grants) made college possible. Many queer students I talked to found that tapping into these networks, both formal and informal, can bridge financial gaps and offer vital encouragement.

Higher education remains a powerful tool for economic mobility and personal growth, and with the right support, it is accessible even in uncertain times.

Financial planning for queer lives isn’t just about hitting savings goals or buying a house. Honestly, if you've managed to accomplish these goals, then you've done better than most in our community. This is about survival, freedom, and long-term joy. The road may be rockier for us, but we still have the agency to shape the path.

Stay safe, stay sharp, stay rooted and above all celebrate who you are.
